"""
	This module downloads lyrics using API LYRICSnMUSIC. LnM API allows 
	a single get request which takes in an api_key, title and artist to
	serch for lyrics. JSON response does not contain entire lyrics but a
	URL to their page which has the full lyrics (licensed).

	Module retrieves the URL and makes a second request from which it scraps off
	the lyrics.
